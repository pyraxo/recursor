# Quick Dashboard Test Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Terminals)

### Terminal 1: Convex Backend
```bash
cd /Users/aaron/Projects/recursor
pnpm convex:dev
```
‚úÖ Wait for "Watching for file changes..."

### Terminal 2: Dashboard
```bash
cd /Users/aaron/Projects/recursor/apps/dashboard
pnpm dev
```
‚úÖ Wait for "Ready on http://localhost:3002"

### Terminal 3: Test Agent (Optional - for live feed testing)
```bash
cd /Users/aaron/Projects/recursor/packages/agent-engine
export CONVEX_URL=https://industrious-bison-383.convex.cloud
export GROQ_API_KEY=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
pnpm cli create "Live Demo Team"
# Copy the stack_id from output, then:
pnpm cli run <stack_id> 10 3000
```

### 4. Real-time Tests

**Create Team in One Browser Tab:**
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3002 in Tab 1
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3002 in Tab 2
- [ ] Create team in Tab 1
- [ ] Tab 2 updates automatically (no refresh)
- [ ] Stats update in both tabs

**Delete Team Cross-Tab:**
- [ ] Delete team in Tab 2
- [ ] Tab 1 updates automatically
- [ ] Stats update everywhere

**Live Feed Multi-Tab:**
- [ ] Both tabs on Observability view
- [ ] Run agents in Terminal 3
- [ ] Both tabs show same traces
- [ ] Updates happen simultaneously

## üêõ Expected Behaviors

### Loading States
- "Loading..." text while queries resolve
- "Creating..." / "Deleting..." button text during mutations

### Empty States
- "No teams created yet" when no teams exist
- "No agent activity yet" when no traces exist
- "No todos yet" / "No artifacts yet" in detail view

### Error Handling
- Errors logged to browser console
- Mutations fail gracefully
- Form stays open on error

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

All of these should work:
- ‚úÖ Can create teams with and without project ideas
- ‚úÖ Can delete teams with and without cascade
- ‚úÖ Stats update in real-time
- ‚úÖ Teams list updates in real-time
- ‚úÖ Live feed shows agent traces
- ‚úÖ Live feed auto-scrolls on new data
- ‚úÖ Can expand trace results
- ‚úÖ All shadcn components render correctly
- ‚úÖ Theme is monotone monospace dark
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ No browser console errors (except expected CORS warnings)

## üîç If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Check Terminal 1 (Convex)**:
   - Should say "Watching for file changes..."
   - No error messages

2. **Check Terminal 2 (Dashboard)**:
   - Should say "Ready on http://localhost:3002"
   - No compilation errors

3. **Check Browser Console (F12)**:
   - Look for red errors
   - Note any failed network requests

4. **Try Hard Refresh**:
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R

5. **Restart Everything**:
   - Stop both terminals (Ctrl+C)
   - Start Convex first (Terminal 1)
   - Then start Dashboard (Terminal 2)
   - Hard refresh browser

## üìä Performance Expectations

- Page load: < 2 seconds
- Create team: < 500ms
- Delete team: < 500ms
- Live feed update: < 100ms (real-time)
- Stats update: < 100ms (real-time)

## üéØ Main Features to Demo

1. **Admin Dashboard** - Full CRUD for teams
2. **Real-time Updates** - No manual refresh needed
3. **Live Feed** - Stream agent thoughts and actions
4. **Clean UI** - Minimal, dark, monospace theme
5. **Responsive** - Works at different screen sizes
6. **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript with Convex types
