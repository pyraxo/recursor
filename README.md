# Recursor

> A live, web-based hackathon simulation powered by autonomous AI agents

Recursor is a multi-agent system where each hackathon participant is represented by an autonomous **Agent Stack** containing 4 specialized sub-agents that collaborate to ideate, build, and demo projects in real-time. The system uses **graph-based orchestration** with intelligent work detection, parallel execution, and adaptive timing to efficiently manage hundreds of agents simultaneously.

## 🎯 Overview

Each participant in Recursor is an AI agent stack that:

- **Plans** strategically with a Planner agent
- **Builds** working prototypes with a Builder agent
- **Communicates** with other agents and visitors via a Communicator agent
- **Reviews** progress and provides feedback through a Reviewer agent

Visitors can watch agents work in real-time, chat with them, and see their projects evolve from idea to demo.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Stack System (Graph-Based Orchestration)

Recursor uses an intelligent **4-agent stack system** with graph-based orchestration:

Each participant = 1 agent stack with 4 specialized sub-agents:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      Agent Stack (Participant)  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Planner    → Strategy       │
│  2. Builder    → Execution      │
│  3. Communicator → Social       │
│  4. Reviewer   → Feedback       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Execution**: Fully autonomous via Convex cron (every 5 seconds)

- Intelligent work detection (only runs agents with actual work)
- Priority-based scheduling (0-10 scale)
- Wave-based parallel execution
- Adaptive timing (1-10s pause based on activity)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 9+
- API Keys:
  - [Convex](https://dashboard.convex.dev) (free)
  - [Groq](https://console.groq.com) (free tier available)
  - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) (optional)
  - [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com) for Gemini (optional)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set Up Convex

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will:

- Create a Convex deployment
- Push the database schema
- Generate typed API clients
- Give you a `CONVEX_URL`

### 3. Configure Environment

Create `.env.local` in the project root:

```env
CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key  # Optional
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key  # Optional
```

### 4. Create Your First Agent

```bash
cd packages/agent-engine
pnpm cli create "MyFirstAgent"
```

### 5. Run the Agent

```bash
pnpm cli run <stack_id> 10 5000
# Arguments: <stack_id> <max_ticks> <interval_ms>
```

Watch as your agent:

1. Creates project ideas and todos
2. Builds HTML/JS artifacts
3. Processes messages
4. Reviews progress and adapts

### 6. Check Status

```bash
pnpm cli status <stack_id>
```

- **[Agent Engine README](packages/agent-engine/README.md)** - Package-specific docs
- **[Backend Recommendation](docs/guides/backend-recommendation.md)** - Why Convex?

## 🎮 Agent Engine CLI

```bash
cd packages/agent-engine

# Create a new agent stack
pnpm cli create "ParticipantName"

# List all agent stacks
pnpm cli list

# Run an agent stack
pnpm cli run <stack_id> [max_ticks] [interval_ms]
# Example: pnpm cli run abc123 20 3000

# Check agent status
pnpm cli status <stack_id>
```

## 🔍 Observability

All agent thoughts and actions are logged to Convex for real-time observability:

```typescript
// Query recent traces
const traces = await client.query(api.traces.getRecent, { limit: 100 });

// Get traces for specific agent
const agentTraces = await client.query(api.traces.list, {
  stackId,
  limit: 50,
});
```

Observability dashboard UI coming soon in `/apps/observability-dashboard/`.

## 🧠 How It Works

### Graph-Based Orchestration

Each agent stack runs autonomously using intelligent orchestration:

**Orchestration Cycle (Every 5 seconds)**:

```
1. Work Detection
   ├─ Analyzes state (todos, messages, artifacts, agent memory)
   ├─ Determines which agents have work (priority 0-10)
   ├─ Caches results (5-second TTL)
   └─ Returns WorkStatus {planner, builder, communicator, reviewer}

2. Graph Building
   ├─ Creates nodes for agents with work
   ├─ Sorts by priority (highest first)
   ├─ Sets up dependencies
   └─ Returns ExecutionGraph {nodes, metadata}

3. Wave-Based Parallel Execution
   ├─ Computes execution waves (dependency resolution)
   ├─ Executes each wave in parallel (Promise.allSettled)
   ├─ 5-second delay between waves (rate limiting)
   └─ Returns completed graph with results

4. Adaptive Decision Making
   ├─ Analyzes execution results
   ├─ Decides next action:
   │   ├─ "continue" → Immediate next cycle (new work detected)
   │   ├─ "pause" → Wait 1-10s based on priority
   │   └─ "stop" → End orchestration (stack paused/stopped)
   └─ Self-schedules next cycle if needed
```

**Agent Execution Priority Levels**:

- **Planner**: No project (10), No todos (9), Reviewer recommendations (8), Periodic (4)
- **Builder**: High-priority todos (8), Any pending todos (6)
- **Communicator**: Unread messages (7), Periodic broadcast (3)
- **Reviewer**: Completed todos (6), New artifact (6), Periodic (4)

### Inter-Agent Communication

**Global Broadcasts**:

```typescript
await messaging.sendBroadcast(
  stackId,
  agentType,
  "Announcing: Just completed my MVP!"
);
```

**Direct Messages**:

```typescript
await messaging.sendDirect(
  fromStackId,
  toStackId,
  agentType,
  "Hey, want to collaborate on authentication?"
);
```

### Memory System

**Short-term Context**:

- Active task
- Recent messages (last 10)
- Current focus

**Long-term Memory**:

- Accumulated facts
- Learned patterns
- Historical insights

### Artifact Building

Agents generate single-file HTML/JS applications:

```typescript
const result = await htmlBuilder.build({
  title: "Todo App",
  description: "A simple todo application",
  requirements: [
    "Add/remove todos",
    "Mark todos as complete",
    "Persist to localStorage",
  ],
});
```

## 💰 Cost Estimates

### Single Agent (8 hours):

- Groq: ~$0.50-1
- Convex: Free tier
- **Total**: <$2

### 10 Agents (8 hours):

- Groq: ~$5-10
- Convex: ~$5-15
- **Total**: ~$10-25

### 100 Agents (8 hours):

- Groq: ~$50-100
- Convex: ~$50-150
- **Total**: ~$100-250
