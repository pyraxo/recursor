# Cursor Team Implementation - Complete ‚úÖ

**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: Implementation Complete (Phases 1-3 of 4)
**Developer**: Claude (Anthropic)

---

## üéØ Overview

Successfully implemented a new "Cursor Team" option for the Recursor dashboard that allows users to choose between:
- **Standard Multi-Agent**: Traditional 4-agent system (Planner, Builder, Communicator, Reviewer)
- **Cursor Background Agent**: Single autonomous agent with full IDE tooling in isolated VM

This implementation maintains full backward compatibility with existing standard teams while adding powerful new capabilities through Cursor's Background Agents API.

## üîß Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Minimal Data Model Changes**
   - Used optional fields for backward compatibility
   - No migration required for existing teams
   - Clean separation between standard and cursor teams

2. **Factory Pattern**
   - Single entry point for orchestrator creation
   - Automatic team type detection
   - Seamless switching based on team configuration

3. **Unified Prompting**
   - Consolidated 4 agent roles into single comprehensive prompt
   - Maintains role clarity while simplifying coordination
   - Leverages Cursor's IDE tooling instead of manual coordination

4. **Clean Code Principles**
   - Small, focused functions with clear responsibilities
   - Self-documenting code with meaningful names
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Type-safe throughout (TypeScript)

### Key Features

- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic workspace creation and cleanup
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Artifacts flow between Convex and Git repos
- **Environment Configuration**: Custom tools and environment variables for agents
- **Tech Stack Detection**: Automatic identification of project technologies
- **Workspace Reuse**: Efficient resource management
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling at every layer

## üöÄ How to Use

### Creating a Cursor Team (Dashboard)

1. Navigate to Admin panel
2. Click "Create New Team"
3. Enter participant name
4. Select "Cursor Background Agent" radio option
5. Optionally provide initial project idea
6. Click "Create Team"

### Creating a Cursor Team (CLI)

```bash
# Create cursor team
pnpm cli create MyTeam --type=cursor

# Create standard team (default)
pnpm cli create MyTeam --type=standard
# or simply
pnpm cli create MyTeam
```

### Running Teams

```bash
# Run any team (auto-detects type)
pnpm cli run <stack_id>

# View team status
pnpm cli status <stack_id>

# List all teams (shows team type)
pnpm cli list
```

### Required Environment Variables

**For Standard Teams:**
- `CONVEX_URL` - Convex deployment URL
- `GROQ_API_KEY` - Groq API key (or other LLM provider)

**For Cursor Teams (additional):**
- `CURSOR_API_KEY` - API key from Cursor Dashboard

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **API Availability**: Cursor Background Agents API is in beta; availability not confirmed
2. **Cost**: ~10x higher per agent compared to standard teams ($9/mo vs $0.86/mo optimized)
3. **External Dependencies**: Requires both Cursor API and GitHub API access
4. **Limited Observability**: Agents run in remote VMs, harder to debug
5. **Testing Incomplete**: Phase 4 testing not yet performed

## üí° Design Principles Applied

Throughout this implementation, the following principles were maintained:

1. **Clean Code**
   - Small functions with single responsibilities
   - Meaningful names (no abbreviations)
   - Self-documenting through clear structure
   - Comprehensive JSDoc for public APIs

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - API client handles only HTTP communication
   - Workspace manager handles only GitHub operations
   - Artifact sync handles only data transformation
   - Orchestrator coordinates but doesn't implement details

3. **Error Handling**
   - Try-catch at every external API call
   - Clear error messages with context
   - Graceful degradation where possible
   - Comprehensive logging

4. **Type Safety**
   - Full TypeScript throughout
   - Interfaces for all data structures
   - No `any` types (except where necessary)
   - Convex schema validation

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Optional fields with defaults
   - No breaking changes to existing APIs
   - Standard teams continue working unchanged
   - Factory pattern abstracts differences
