## üöß IN PROGRESS / NEXT UP

### Autonomous Agent Execution System (CRITICAL)

**Key Architectural Change Needed**:

- Currently: Agent-engine orchestrator designed for CLI usage (`pnpm cli run`)
- Required: Agents run autonomously via Convex scheduled functions
- When: Starts automatically when `pnpm dev` runs, continues in background
- Control: Play/Pause/Stop via dashboard UI (updates `execution_state` in DB)

**Why This Blocks Everything**: Can't properly test, demo, or scale without autonomous execution

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create Convex scheduled function for agent orchestration
  - [ ] Runs agent tick loops automatically (every 5-10 seconds)
  - [ ] Respects execution_state (running, paused, stopped)
  - [ ] Calls orchestrator logic from `agent-engine` package
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Build Play/Pause UI component (IN PROGRESS per user)
  - [ ] Global play/pause for all agents
  - [ ] Per-team play/pause controls
  - [ ] Status indicators (running, paused, stopped)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Connect agent-engine orchestrator to Convex
  - [ ] Update orchestrator to use Convex mutations/queries
  - [ ] Remove CLI dependency for agent execution
  - [ ] Make it callable from Convex scheduled functions

### Testing & Validation (Ready after Autonomous Execution)

- [ ] Test agents run automatically on `pnpm dev`
- [ ] Verify play/pause controls work
- [ ] Test single agent through full tick cycle
- [ ] Verify artifacts are generated correctly
- [ ] Test messaging between 2+ agent stacks
- [ ] Monitor costs during test runs

## üìù NOTES & DECISIONS

### Technical Decisions Made

- ‚úÖ Convex over Supabase (real-time priority)
- ‚úÖ Groq as primary LLM (speed + cost)
- ‚úÖ Custom agents over Mastra (simplicity)
- ‚úÖ Single HTML files for Phase 1 builds
- ‚úÖ Observability dashboard built before public frontend (smart for debugging)
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous execution via Convex scheduled functions (NOT CLI-based)**
- ‚úÖ **Convex orchestration over Mastra framework** (see `/docs/analysis/ORCHESTRATION_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md`)
  - Reason: Already 80% built on Convex, proven at scale, simpler architecture
  - Convex can easily handle 100+ agents with <5s latency
  - Bottleneck is LLM APIs (Groq), not orchestration
  - Mastra adds complexity without solving actual constraint
- ‚úÖ **Judging, Leaderboards, Admin Console, and Communication are MUST-DELIVER features**
  - Cannot launch without these critical systems
  - Reprioritized from "medium" to "critical"
  - Timeline extended to accommodate (17-26 days vs 10-16 days)

### Key Technical Implementation Notes

**Convex Scheduled Functions for Autonomous Execution**:

```typescript
// packages/convex/convex/orchestration.ts
export const runAgentTicks = internalMutation({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    // 1. Find all stacks with execution_state: 'running'
    const runningStacks = await ctx.db
      .query("agent_stacks")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("execution_state"), "running"))
      .collect();

    // 2. For each stack, run one tick
    for (const stack of runningStacks) {
      await runSingleAgentTick(ctx, stack._id);
    }
  },
});

// Schedule to run every 10 seconds
export default {
  runAgentTicks: {
    schedule: "0/10 * * * * *", // Every 10 seconds
    handler: runAgentTicks,
  },
};
```

**Agent-Engine Refactor**:

- Move from CLI-driven to function-based
- Export `runAgentTick(stackId, convexClient)` from orchestrator
- Make it callable from Convex actions
- Use Convex client to read/write state

**Execution State Management**:

- Dashboard sets `execution_state` via mutations
- Scheduled function respects state
- States: `idle`, `running`, `paused`, `stopped`
- Track: `last_activity_at`, `started_at`, `paused_at`

**Schema Extensions Required**:

```typescript
// New tables needed for MUST-DELIVER features:

// 1. Judges table
judges: defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  persona: v.string(), // "technical", "design", "product", etc.
  expertise: v.array(v.string()),
  llm_config: v.object({
    model: v.string(),
    temperature: v.number(),
  }),
  calibration_data: v.optional(v.any()),
});

// 2. Judgments table
judgments: defineTable({
  project_id: v.id("agent_stacks"),
  judge_id: v.id("judges"),
  round: v.string(), // "checkpoint", "final"
  scores: v.object({
    problem_fit: v.number(), // 0-10
    execution: v.number(),
    ux_design: v.number(),
    originality: v.number(),
    impact: v.number(),
    total: v.number(), // weighted
  }),
  feedback: v.object({
    problem_fit: v.string(),
    execution: v.string(),
    ux_design: v.string(),
    originality: v.string(),
    impact: v.string(),
    overall: v.string(),
  }),
  confidence: v.optional(v.number()),
})
  .index("by_project", ["project_id"])
  .index("by_round", ["round"]);

// 3. Votes table
votes: defineTable({
  project_id: v.id("agent_stacks"),
  voter_id: v.optional(v.string()), // IP hash or user ID
  voter_type: v.string(), // "anonymous", "authenticated"
  vote_value: v.number(), // 1-5 stars or +1
  weight: v.number(), // vote multiplier
  ip_hash: v.optional(v.string()),
})
  .index("by_project", ["project_id"])
  .index("by_voter", ["voter_id"]);

// 4. Extend messages table for user chat
messages: defineTable({
  // ... existing fields ...
  sender_type: v.string(), // "agent", "user"
  user_id: v.optional(v.string()), // session ID for anonymous users
  session_id: v.optional(v.string()),
  requires_response: v.optional(v.boolean()),
  response_priority: v.optional(v.number()),
  // ... existing fields ...
});
```

### Open Questions (from PRD section 14)

- ‚ùì Discord server admin permission for data ingestion?
- ‚ùì Visitor votes: gated by account or anonymous with anti-bot?
- ‚ùì Agent count given budget constraints? (Start with 50-100)
- ‚ùì Mode priority: Quantity, Incremental, or Quality? (Lean Quantity for MVP)
- ‚ùì Sponsor tracks to highlight?
- ‚ùì Live bridge to real Discord or sandboxed? (Sandboxed for MVP)

### Risks to Monitor

- Model cost overruns ‚Üí Hard budgets, tick throttling
- Data/PII from Discord ‚Üí Pseudonymize by default, consent workflow
- Content safety ‚Üí Need moderation before public launch
- Performance under load ‚Üí Load test before event
- Flaky video generation ‚Üí Deprioritize for MVP
