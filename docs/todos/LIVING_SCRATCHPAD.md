## üöß IN PROGRESS / NEXT UP

### Autonomous Agent Execution System (CRITICAL)

**Key Architectural Change Needed**:

- Currently: Agent-engine orchestrator designed for CLI usage (`pnpm cli run`)
- Required: Agents run autonomously via Convex scheduled functions
- When: Starts automatically when `pnpm dev` runs, continues in background
- Control: Play/Pause/Stop via dashboard UI (updates `execution_state` in DB)

**Why This Blocks Everything**: Can't properly test, demo, or scale without autonomous execution

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create Convex scheduled function for agent orchestration
  - [ ] Runs agent tick loops automatically (every 5-10 seconds)
  - [ ] Respects execution_state (running, paused, stopped)
  - [ ] Calls orchestrator logic from `agent-engine` package
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Build Play/Pause UI component (IN PROGRESS per user)
  - [ ] Global play/pause for all agents
  - [ ] Per-team play/pause controls
  - [ ] Status indicators (running, paused, stopped)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Connect agent-engine orchestrator to Convex
  - [ ] Update orchestrator to use Convex mutations/queries
  - [ ] Remove CLI dependency for agent execution
  - [ ] Make it callable from Convex scheduled functions

### Testing & Validation (Ready after Autonomous Execution)

- [ ] Test agents run automatically on `pnpm dev`
- [ ] Verify play/pause controls work
- [ ] Test single agent through full tick cycle
- [ ] Verify artifacts are generated correctly
- [ ] Test messaging between 2+ agent stacks
- [ ] Monitor costs during test runs

## üìù NOTES & DECISIONS

### Technical Decisions Made

- ‚úÖ Convex over Supabase (real-time priority)
- ‚úÖ Groq as primary LLM (speed + cost)
- ‚úÖ Custom agents over Mastra (simplicity)
- ‚úÖ Single HTML files for Phase 1 builds
- ‚úÖ Observability dashboard built before public frontend (smart for debugging)
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous execution via Convex scheduled functions (NOT CLI-based)**
- ‚úÖ **Convex orchestration over Mastra framework** (see `/docs/analysis/ORCHESTRATION_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md`)
  - Reason: Already 80% built on Convex, proven at scale, simpler architecture
  - Convex can easily handle 100+ agents with <5s latency
  - Bottleneck is LLM APIs (Groq), not orchestration
  - Mastra adds complexity without solving actual constraint

### Key Technical Implementation Notes

**Convex Scheduled Functions for Autonomous Execution**:

```typescript
// packages/convex/convex/orchestration.ts
export const runAgentTicks = internalMutation({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    // 1. Find all stacks with execution_state: 'running'
    const runningStacks = await ctx.db
      .query("agent_stacks")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("execution_state"), "running"))
      .collect();

    // 2. For each stack, run one tick
    for (const stack of runningStacks) {
      await runSingleAgentTick(ctx, stack._id);
    }
  },
});

// Schedule to run every 10 seconds
export default {
  runAgentTicks: {
    schedule: "0/10 * * * * *", // Every 10 seconds
    handler: runAgentTicks,
  },
};
```

**Agent-Engine Refactor**:

- Move from CLI-driven to function-based
- Export `runAgentTick(stackId, convexClient)` from orchestrator
- Make it callable from Convex actions
- Use Convex client to read/write state

**Execution State Management**:

- Dashboard sets `execution_state` via mutations
- Scheduled function respects state
- States: `idle`, `running`, `paused`, `stopped`
- Track: `last_activity_at`, `started_at`, `paused_at`

### Open Questions (from PRD section 14)

- ‚ùì Discord server admin permission for data ingestion?
- ‚ùì Visitor votes: gated by account or anonymous with anti-bot?
- ‚ùì Agent count given budget constraints? (Start with 50-100)
- ‚ùì Mode priority: Quantity, Incremental, or Quality? (Lean Quantity for MVP)
- ‚ùì Sponsor tracks to highlight?
- ‚ùì Live bridge to real Discord or sandboxed? (Sandboxed for MVP)

### Risks to Monitor

- Model cost overruns ‚Üí Hard budgets, tick throttling
- Data/PII from Discord ‚Üí Pseudonymize by default, consent workflow
- Content safety ‚Üí Need moderation before public launch
- Performance under load ‚Üí Load test before event
- Flaky video generation ‚Üí Deprioritize for MVP

## üé¨ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow) - CRITICAL PATH

**Goal**: Make agents run autonomously when `pnpm dev` starts

1. **Create Convex Orchestration System** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - Create `packages/convex/convex/orchestration.ts`
   - Use Convex scheduled functions (cron-like)
   - Query for `execution_state: 'running'` stacks
   - Execute one tick per stack per interval
   - Update all state in Convex (traces, todos, artifacts, messages)

2. **Refactor Agent-Engine for Convex Integration**
   - Make orchestrator callable from Convex actions
   - Remove CLI-only dependencies
   - Export `runAgentTick(stackId)` function
   - Ensure it works with Convex mutations/queries

3. **Build Play/Pause Controls in Dashboard**
   - Add global "Start All" / "Pause All" buttons to Admin view
   - Add per-team play/pause/stop buttons
   - Create Convex mutations to update `execution_state`
   - Show visual indicators (üü¢ running, ‚è∏Ô∏è paused, ‚èπÔ∏è stopped)

4. **Test End-to-End**
   - Create team via dashboard
   - Click "Start" to set execution_state to 'running'
   - Watch agent traces appear in real-time
   - Verify todos, artifacts, messages are created
   - Test pause/resume functionality

### Next (This Week)

5. **Tune Agent Behavior**
   - Monitor trace output quality

   - Live activity feed (similar to dashboard)
   - Basic agent/project cards
   - Public-facing view (non-admin)

### After Autonomous System Works

7. **Scale Testing**
