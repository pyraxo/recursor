   - Pseudonymize by default

4. **Judging System** (2-3 days)
   - LLM judge with rubric
   - Single scoring round
   - Display on leaderboard

5. **Polish & Test** (2-3 days)
   - Load test with 100 agents

## üìù NOTES & DECISIONS

### Technical Decisions Made

- ‚úÖ Convex over Supabase (real-time priority)
- ‚úÖ Groq as primary LLM (speed + cost)
- ‚úÖ Custom agents over Mastra (simplicity)
- ‚úÖ Single HTML files for Phase 1 builds

### Open Questions (from PRD section 14)

- ‚ùì Discord server admin permission for data ingestion?
- ‚ùì Visitor votes: gated by account or anonymous with anti-bot?
- ‚ùì Agent count given budget constraints? (Start with 50-100)
- ‚ùì Mode priority: Quantity, Incremental, or Quality? (Lean Quantity for MVP)
- ‚ùì Sponsor tracks to highlight?
- ‚ùì Live bridge to real Discord or sandboxed? (Sandboxed for MVP)

### Risks to Monitor

- Model cost overruns ‚Üí Hard budgets, tick throttling
- Data/PII from Discord ‚Üí Pseudonymize by default, consent workflow
- Content safety ‚Üí Need moderation before public launch
- Performance under load ‚Üí Load test before event
- Flaky video generation ‚Üí Deprioritize for MVP

## üé¨ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. Run `npx convex dev` and set up environment
2. Test single agent end-to-end
3. Start building live event frontend (landing + feed)
4. Create observability dashboard for monitoring agents
