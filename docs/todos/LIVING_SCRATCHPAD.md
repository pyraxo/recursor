## üöß IN PROGRESS / NEXT UP

### Autonomous Agent Execution System ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Major Architectural Achievement**: Agents now run autonomously via Convex!

**What Was Built**:

‚úÖ **Convex Backend Agent Execution**:
- ‚úÖ All agent logic migrated to Convex actions (`packages/convex/convex/lib/agents/`)
  - `executePlanner()` - Handles planning logic in Convex
  - `executeBuilder()` - Handles building logic in Convex
  - `executeCommunicator()` - Handles communication logic in Convex
  - `executeReviewer()` - Handles review logic in Convex
- ‚úÖ Agent classes in `agent-engine` are now thin wrappers that delegate to Convex
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for agent logic (works in CLI, cron, dashboard)

‚úÖ **Scheduled Execution System** (`packages/convex/convex/agentExecution.ts`):
- ‚úÖ `scheduledExecutor` runs every 5 seconds via Convex cron
- ‚úÖ Finds all stacks with `execution_state: 'running'`
- ‚úÖ Executes agent ticks automatically
- ‚úÖ Respects execution state (running, paused, stopped)
- ‚úÖ 30-second timeout protection for stuck executions
- ‚úÖ New `agent_executions` table tracks execution status

‚úÖ **Client-Side Orchestration** (`packages/agent-engine/src/`):
- ‚úÖ `AutonomousOrchestrator` (846 lines) - Advanced work-based orchestration:
  - Work detection interface (`WorkStatus`) for smart agent activation
  - Priority queue system for agent task scheduling
  - Configurable concurrency (max concurrent agents)
  - Pause/resume/stop controls
  - Real-time Convex subscriptions for state changes
- ‚úÖ `ExecutionController` - Manages multiple orchestrators
  - Multi-stack coordination
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Monitoring and health checks
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `BaseAgent` with work detection:
  - `hasWork()` method to detect available work
  - `processWork()` for custom work handling
  - `handleNoWork()` for idle state (no unnecessary LLM calls)

‚úÖ **Schema Enhancements**:
- ‚úÖ `agent_executions` table for execution tracking
- ‚úÖ `current_agent_index` in `agent_stacks` (cycle through 4 agents)
- ‚úÖ Execution state fields in `agent_states.memory`
- ‚úÖ Work tracking metadata

**Status**: Core autonomous execution is COMPLETE. Ready for testing and refinement.

**Next**: Focus shifts to testing, UI polish, and MUST-DELIVER features (Communication, Judging, Leaderboards, Admin)

### Testing & Validation (Ready after Autonomous Execution)

- [ ] Test agents run automatically on `pnpm dev`
- [ ] Verify play/pause controls work
- [ ] Test single agent through full tick cycle

## üìù NOTES & DECISIONS

### Technical Decisions Made

- ‚úÖ Convex over Supabase (real-time priority)
- ‚úÖ Groq as primary LLM (speed + cost)
- ‚úÖ Custom agents over Mastra (simplicity)
- ‚úÖ Single HTML files for Phase 1 builds
- ‚úÖ Observability dashboard built before public frontend (smart for debugging)
- ‚úÖ **Autonomous execution via Convex scheduled functions (NOT CLI-based)**
- ‚úÖ **Convex orchestration over Mastra framework** (see `/docs/analysis/ORCHESTRATION_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md`)
  - Reason: Already 80% built on Convex, proven at scale, simpler architecture
  - Convex can easily handle 100+ agents with <5s latency
  - Bottleneck is LLM APIs (Groq), not orchestration
  - Mastra adds complexity without solving actual constraint
- ‚úÖ **Judging, Leaderboards, Admin Console, and Communication are MUST-DELIVER features**
  - Cannot launch without these critical systems
  - Reprioritized from "medium" to "critical"
  - Timeline extended to accommodate (17-26 days vs 10-16 days)

### Key Technical Implementation Notes

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Convex Scheduled Execution System**:

```typescript
// packages/convex/convex/agentExecution.ts
export const scheduledExecutor = internalMutation({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    // 1. Find all stacks with execution_state: 'running'
    const stacks = await ctx.db
      .query("agent_stacks")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("execution_state"), "running"))
      .collect();

    // 2. For each stack, schedule an agent tick
    for (const stack of stacks) {
      await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.agentExecution.executeAgentTick, {
        stackId: stack._id,
      });
    }
  },
});

// Runs every 5 seconds (configured in Convex cron settings)
```

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Agent Logic Migration to Convex**:

All agent execution logic has been moved from `packages/agent-engine/src/agents/` to Convex backend:

```
packages/convex/convex/lib/agents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts          # executeAgentByType() dispatcher
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ planner.ts        # executePlanner() - planning logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ builder.ts        # executeBuilder() - building logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ communicator.ts   # executeCommunicator() - communication logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reviewer.ts       # executeReviewer() - review logic
```

**Agent Classes Now Delegate to Convex**:

```typescript
// packages/agent-engine/src/agents/planner.ts (simplified)
export class PlannerAgent extends BaseAgent {
  async think(): Promise<string> {
    // Call Convex backend to execute planner logic
    const result = await this.client.action(api.agentExecution.runPlanner, {
      stackId: this.stackId,
    });
    return result;
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Advanced Orchestration Features**:

1. **Work Detection System**:
   - `WorkStatus` interface for detecting available work
   - `hasWork()` method in BaseAgent
   - `handleNoWork()` for idle states (no wasted LLM calls)

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Agent tasks ordered by priority
   - Configurable concurrency (max agents running)
   - Fair scheduling across multiple stacks

3. **Execution Monitoring**:
   - `agent_executions` table tracks status
   - 30-second timeout protection
   - Real-time state updates via Convex subscriptions

**Execution State Management**:

- Dashboard updates `execution_state` via mutations
- Scheduled function respects state changes
- States: `idle`, `running`, `paused`, `stopped`
- Tracking: `last_activity_at`, `started_at`, `current_agent_index`

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Schema Extensions**:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ agent_executions table (for autonomous execution tracking)
agent_executions: defineTable({
  stack_id: v.id("agent_stacks"),
  status: v.union(v.literal("running"), v.literal("completed"), v.literal("failed")),
  started_at: v.number(),
  completed_at: v.optional(v.number()),
  error: v.optional(v.string()),
}).index("by_stack", ["stack_id"]);

// New tables needed for MUST-DELIVER features:

// 1. Judges table
judges: defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  persona: v.string(), // "technical", "design", "product", etc.
  expertise: v.array(v.string()),
  llm_config: v.object({
    model: v.string(),
    temperature: v.number(),
  }),
  calibration_data: v.optional(v.any()),
});

// 2. Judgments table
judgments: defineTable({
  project_id: v.id("agent_stacks"),
  judge_id: v.id("judges"),
  round: v.string(), // "checkpoint", "final"
  scores: v.object({
    problem_fit: v.number(), // 0-10
    execution: v.number(),
    ux_design: v.number(),
    originality: v.number(),
    impact: v.number(),
    total: v.number(), // weighted
  }),
  feedback: v.object({
    problem_fit: v.string(),
    execution: v.string(),
    ux_design: v.string(),
    originality: v.string(),
    impact: v.string(),
    overall: v.string(),
  }),
  confidence: v.optional(v.number()),
})
  .index("by_project", ["project_id"])
  .index("by_round", ["round"]);

// 3. Votes table
votes: defineTable({
  project_id: v.id("agent_stacks"),
  voter_id: v.optional(v.string()), // IP hash or user ID
  voter_type: v.string(), // "anonymous", "authenticated"
  vote_value: v.number(), // 1-5 stars or +1
  weight: v.number(), // vote multiplier
  ip_hash: v.optional(v.string()),
})
  .index("by_project", ["project_id"])
  .index("by_voter", ["voter_id"]);

// 4. Extend messages table for user chat
messages: defineTable({
  // ... existing fields ...
  sender_type: v.string(), // "agent", "user"
  user_id: v.optional(v.string()), // session ID for anonymous users
  session_id: v.optional(v.string()),
  requires_response: v.optional(v.boolean()),
  response_priority: v.optional(v.number()),
  // ... existing fields ...
});
```

### Open Questions (from PRD section 14)

- ‚ùì Discord server admin permission for data ingestion?
- ‚ùì Visitor votes: gated by account or anonymous with anti-bot?
- ‚ùì Agent count given budget constraints? (Start with 50-100)
- ‚ùì Mode priority: Quantity, Incremental, or Quality? (Lean Quantity for MVP)
- ‚ùì Sponsor tracks to highlight?
- ‚ùì Live bridge to real Discord or sandboxed? (Sandboxed for MVP)

### Risks to Monitor

- Model cost overruns ‚Üí Hard budgets, tick throttling
- Data/PII from Discord ‚Üí Pseudonymize by default, consent workflow
