# Backend Recommendation: Convex vs Supabase for VibeHack

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Use Convex as the primary backend**

After analyzing the PRD for VibeHack (the live hackathon simulation), **Convex is the clear winner** for this project. The core requirements revolve around real-time interactions, live updates, and reactive data synchronization - all of which are Convex's primary strengths.

## Detailed Analysis

### Critical Project Requirements from PRD

1. **Real-time is the core feature** (not just a nice-to-have)
   - Live feed of agent interactions
   - Real-time chat between visitors and agents
   - Dynamic leaderboards
   - <1s perceived latency requirement
   - WebSocket/SSE for live updates

2. **Scale requirements**
   - 300-500 concurrent AI agents
   - 1,000+ concurrent viewers
   - Hundreds of simultaneous updates

3. **High-frequency interaction patterns**
   - Agent "ticks" (event loop updates)
   - Continuous project status updates
   - Visitor-agent chat interactions
   - Real-time voting and scoring

4. **No authentication needed** (current phase)

## Why Convex Wins

### Perfect Match for Core Requirements

| Requirement | Convex | Supabase | Winner |
|------------|---------|----------|---------|
| Real-time updates | Native, automatic | Requires setup | ✅ Convex |
| <1s latency | Optimistic updates built-in | Manual implementation | ✅ Convex |
| Live chat | Reactive queries | Requires WebSocket setup | ✅ Convex |
| Agent state management | Reactive, automatic sync | Manual pub/sub | ✅ Convex |
| High-frequency writes | Designed for this | Can handle but not optimized | ✅ Convex |
| Type safety | TypeScript-first | Partial | ✅ Convex |
| Developer velocity | Instant hot-reload | Slower iteration | ✅ Convex |

### Specific Advantages for VibeHack

#### 1. Real-time Agent Simulation
```typescript
// Convex makes agent updates trivial
export const updateAgentState = mutation({
  args: {
    agentId: v.string(),
    phase: v.string(),
    status: v.string()
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Update automatically syncs to all viewers
    await ctx.db.patch(args.agentId, {
      phase: args.phase,
      status: args.status,
      lastUpdate: Date.now()
    });
  }
});

// React component automatically updates
function AgentView({ agentId }) {
  // This re-renders automatically when agent updates
  const agent = useQuery(api.agents.get, { id: agentId });
  return <div>{agent?.status}</div>;
}
```

#### 2. Live Activity Feed
```typescript
// Convex: Automatic real-time feed
export const getActivityFeed = query({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    // Returns live, reactive data
    return await ctx.db
      .query("activities")
      .order("desc")
      .take(50);
  }
});

// Supabase: Would require manual WebSocket setup
// Plus handling reconnections, state sync, etc.
```

#### 3. Optimistic Updates for <1s Latency
```typescript
// Convex: Built-in optimistic updates
const sendMessage = useMutation(api.chat.send);
// UI updates instantly, server confirms later
await sendMessage({ text: "Hello" });

// Supabase: Must implement optimistic updates manually
```

#### 4. Agent Event Loop ("Ticks")
```typescript
// Convex: Easy to implement with scheduled functions
export const agentTick = internalMutation({
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const agents = await ctx.db.query("agents").collect();

    // Process all agents in parallel
    await Promise.all(agents.map(agent =>
      processAgentTick(ctx, agent)
    ));

    // Schedule next tick
    await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(1000, internal.simulation.agentTick);
  }
});
```

### Performance & Scale

Convex handles the exact scale requirements:
- ✅ 300-500 concurrent agents making updates
- ✅ 1,000+ viewers receiving real-time updates
- ✅ Automatic horizontal scaling
- ✅ No infrastructure management needed

### Developer Experience for Rapid Iteration

Given the aggressive timeline (MVP in 1-2 weeks):
- **Convex**: Write functions, they work instantly
- **Supabase**: Set up tables, RLS policies, WebSocket channels, etc.

## Why Not Supabase?

Supabase is excellent, but not for this project:

1. **Real-time is secondary in Supabase** - It's primarily a PostgreSQL database with real-time added on
2. **More complex setup** - Need to configure:
   - Realtime channels
   - WebSocket connections
   - Manual optimistic updates
   - Pub/sub for agent coordination
3. **Overkill features** - You don't need:
   - Complex SQL queries
   - Row-level security (no auth)
   - PostgreSQL extensions
   - File storage (artifacts can use CDN)

## Migration Path (If Needed)

If you later need Supabase features:
1. Keep Convex for real-time simulation
2. Add Supabase for:
   - Authentication (Phase 2+)
   - Long-term analytics storage
   - File storage for artifacts

## Cost Considerations

For a hackathon simulation:
- **Convex**: Pay for function calls and database operations
  - Estimated: Moderate cost for event duration
  - Built-in cost controls via tick rate adjustment

- **Supabase**: Pay for database size and bandwidth
  - Would also need additional real-time infrastructure
  - Potentially higher total cost

## Implementation Speed Comparison

### Time to implement core features:

| Feature | Convex | Supabase |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Real-time feed | 30 min | 2-3 hours |
| Agent chat | 1 hour | 3-4 hours |
| Live voting | 30 min | 2 hours |
| Agent state sync | 1 hour | 4-5 hours |
| **Total MVP** | **1-2 days** | **4-5 days** |

## Final Recommendation

**Use Convex immediately.** It's purpose-built for exactly what VibeHack needs:
1. Real-time collaborative features
2. Live reactive updates
3. Low-latency interactions
4. Rapid development timeline

You can ship the MVP in days, not weeks, and the real-time features will "just work" without complex configuration.

## Next Steps

1. Initialize Convex in the project:
   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```

2. Define schema for agents, teams, projects, messages

3. Implement core real-time functions:
   - Agent state management
   - Live activity feed
   - Chat system
   - Voting mechanism

4. Build the UI with React + Convex hooks for automatic updates

5. Deploy and iterate rapidly with hot-reload

## Conclusion

For VibeHack's requirements - especially the critical real-time simulation aspects with <1s latency requirements - Convex is the superior choice. It will enable you to build faster, with better real-time performance, and less complexity.

The project is essentially a **massive real-time collaboration app**, which is exactly what Convex was designed to handle.
